Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to install both the backend and frontend dependencies. Follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
MongoDB (or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution)
Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory.
Add the following environment variables:
plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
Seed the database (optional):

bash
Copy code
npm run seed
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev

Final Setup
Make sure both servers are running. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage
Admin Panel: To access the admin panel, you must register and then set your user role to 'admin' directly in the database. Once you're an admin, you can manage products.
Shopping: Browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. You can use test payment credentials if you’ve integrated a payment gateway in development mode.
